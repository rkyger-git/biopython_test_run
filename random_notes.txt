replace stringtie with salmon after using STAR

./bin/salmon quant -t transcripts.fa -l <LIBTYPE> -a aln.bam -o salmon_quant

"If your alignments for the sample you want to quantify appear in multiple .bam/.sam files, then you can simply provide the Salmon -a parameter with a (space-separated) list of these files."
